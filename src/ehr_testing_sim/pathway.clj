(ns ehr-testing-sim.pathway
  "The intermediate pathway representation (IR): the single format that
  both hand-authored scenario scripts and generated trajectories
  compile to, and the only format the engine executes.

  Lineage: the step vocabulary derives from Google's Simulated Hospital
  pathway steps (operational events: admission, transfer, discharge,
  churn like bed swaps, cancellations, merges); the *generation* of
  pathways from probabilistic clinical modules (Synthea GMF) is a
  separate, later layer that compiles down to this IR. Scripted and
  generated trajectories are therefore indistinguishable to the engine.

  A pathway is data (EDN), never code. Concepts are carried as coded
  triplets {:system :code :display} so every emitter (HL7v2 now,
  FHIR/CDA later) renders codes natively with no re-mapping -- codes
  are properties of patient state, not of wire formats.

  The v0 step set is deliberately tiny (walking skeleton): :admission,
  :delay, :discharge. The full Simulated-Hospital-derived vocabulary
  (transfer, bed-swap, *-in-error, cancel-*, merge, order, result, ...)
  lands step by step, each with its engine transition and its
  invariants in ehr-testing-sim.check."
