# Thin, deliberately (R23, ADR-0004, 2026-07-28 carve-loss recovery
# session): every target below is a named entry point to a poly/CLI
# command, not logic of its own. The full pre-carve Makefile
# (pack/pack-skills/pack-push, docsgen targets, lint-pipeline/lint-deps,
# check-palgebra-drift, coverage, integration-smoke) stays superseded
# per ADR-0002's own author-approved decision -- not reopened here; see
# notes/carve-loss-audit.md for the full disposition of every one of
# its old targets.

# ADR-0004's own generalized trap, made runnable: index modes, artifact
# caches, and sibling checkouts have each masked a CI failure behind a
# local green (the executable-bit incident, this same session's own
# cold-cache verification above). A real `git clone` (not a working-tree
# copy) into a scratch dir, with the artifact cache pointed at an empty
# directory via EHR_TESTING_TOOLS_CACHE, running exactly the per-push
# lane `test` above runs -- the closest a local machine can get to
# "what CI actually sees" without a real CI run.
