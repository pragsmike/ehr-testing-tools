  "P1-1 (2026-07-31 review catch-up, finding 4): a stale-path family
  (pre-Polylith `ehr_testing_tools` paths, `test-integration/`, and a
  `docs/experiments/` link missing its component-adjacent `tools/`
  prefix) recurred across four live docs -- this tripwire scans every
  docs/**/*.md file plus components/tools/docs/use-cases.edn (the
  rendered form, docs/use-cases.md, is generated and covered by the
  same scan) so the species can't silently re-accumulate. The
  component-adjacent citation form, `components/tools/docs/experiments/...`,
  is correct and must NOT trip this -- tested both directions below."
